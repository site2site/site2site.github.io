# Interactive Projected Surface

## Description

A system consisting of a camera, projector, Kinect, iPhone (or other smartphone device with location sensor), and website. Cameras record a Studio-X space from above (plan view) and from the side (elevation view), projectors show these videos in real-time on the floors and walls of other Studio-X loctions, Kinects turn these projections into interactive touch screens, iPhone location sensors allow Studio-X users to be tagged and tracked on these screens, and a website displays these screens online to create another layer of interactivity with a global audience.
