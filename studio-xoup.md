### A component deployed in multiple architectural scenarios that weaves a common thread between spaces of differing program, user, and location, providing a platform for interaction and cross pollination.

### Individually, these components are pretty simple. but when put together and deployed in studio X, the possibilities of how to use Studio Xoup are almost infinite.
