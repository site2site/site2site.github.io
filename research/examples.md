### HYDRAMAX Port Machines

Posted by @cbadal

Future Cities Lab’s [HYDRAMAX Port Machines](http://www.future-cities-lab.net/hydramax/) project proposes a radical rethinking of San Francisco’s urban waterfront post sea-level rise. The proposal renders the existing hard edges of the waterfront as new “soft systems” that would include aquatic parks, community gardens, wildlife refuges and aquaponic farms. A synthetic architecture is introduced that blurs the distinction between building, landscape, infrastructure and machine. Using thousands of sensors and motorized components, the massive urban scale robotic structure harvests rainwater and fog, while modulating air flow, solar exposure and intelligent building systems.

Interactive Model Description: A network of infrared proximity sensors has been integrated into the four sides of the physical model. These sensors record the distance of gallery visitors to its edges. Information from these sensors is used to actuate the white feather-like “fog harvesting robots” and control the brightness of embedded LEDS. This model is an example of what Future Cities Labs call “live models”. Live models use the interaction of people to explore and simulate the potential effects of environmental forces such as fog, wind and sunlight.

### Vessels

Posted by @cbadal

[Vessels](http://vessels.perte-de-signal.org/) is a robotic installation consisting of large groups of autonomous water vehicles. With roughly 50 individuals in a population, the robotic agents interact with each other and their environment to form a simple ecosystem. Their collective, emergent behaviour resembles the social interactions in a community of living creatures. While moving on water, each of the robots collect and interpret data from different environmental conditions such as water and air quality, temperature, ambient light, sound, etc. Since no single agent has more than one or two sensors, they depend on communicating with each other to form a complete awareness of their environment. However, the robots do not simply exchange scientific readings: instead they communicate through behaviours and interactions. For example, an increase in temperature sensed by one agent may cause it to act more aggressively, with erratic or irrational (random) movements. This change in behaviour will influence its neighbouring agents, who may respond with relative changes to their own behaviour. These agents will in turn influence their neighbours, thus creating a ripple effect of actions. Over time, a collective behaviour that is specific to the immediate environmental characteristics of the presentation site emerges from the agents’ interactions.

### T(ether)

Posted by @cbadal

[T(ether)] (http://kiwi.media.mit.edu/tether/) is a novel spatially aware display that supports intuitive interaction with volumetric data. The display acts as a window affording users a perspective view of three- dimensional data through tracking of head position and orientation. T(ether) creates a 1:1 mapping between real and virtual coordinate space allowing immersive exploration of the joint domain. Our system creates a shared workspace in which co-located or remote users can collaborate in both the real and virtual worlds. The system allows input through capacitive touch on the display and a motion-tracked glove. When placed behind the display, the user’s hand extends into the virtual world, enabling the user to interact with objects directly.

### Local Warming

Posted by @cbadal

[Local Warming] (http://senseable.mit.edu/local-warming/) is a prototype that aims to challenge the status quo. Through the use of sophisticated motion sensing and autonomous control, the installation provides people with direct and localized warmth. An infrared energy beam follows the user’s movement so they can be comfortably warm in an otherwise cold environment and thus the inefficiencies of ambient heating are avoided all together. For this installation, the participants are welcomed by a carpet marked with symbolic foot prints. By standing in this location, the users can engage the system, and the warmth will follow them through space. By installing the system outdoors, the paradigm shifting possibilities are amplified. It provides the ability to manipulate unenclosed environments—in an efficient manner—to a degree allowing us to utterly blur the architectural boundary between interior and exterior beyond the removal of physical obstructions.

### Interior Weather

Posted by @cbadal

The [installation](http://www.philipperahm.com/data/projects/interiorweather/) at the CCA is conceived as two spaces, one gallery designated as the locus of production and measurement of an "interior weather" condition, and the other as the locus of interpretation of the resultant data. The first room could be described as objective, the second as subjective. The goal is to project an architecture that is capable of indicating possible uses of space which are dictated only by the chance confluence of three climatic parameters: temperature (celsius), light intensity (lux), and relative humidity (%), so that T * lux * HR = form and function. The installation is conceived as a study to test the potential of fluctuating climatic conditions to generate new functions, and thus new architectural programmes. The proposals offered here are in no sense univocal: they represent the realm of sheer accident and possibility, one interpretation, and obviously not the only one. 

Note: You should read the rest of the description on the Philippe Rahm website to make any sense of this.

### Wireless Sensor Network

Posted by @cbadal

From the KieranTimberlake [blog](http://blog.kierantimberlake.com/2013/03/building-monitoring-and-imaging-thermal-performance/) on one particular application:
Architects rely on energy models to verify that buildings will perform to desired energy standards, but simulation alone does not provide a tacit understanding of the nuanced conditions buildings experience over time. To supplement energy models, we deploy sensor networks to monitor environmental attributes such as temperature, relative humidity, and carbon dioxide. This is particularly relevant to building retrofits, where the data informs performance modifications, targeting both energy efficiency and occupant comfort, all intended to improve existing building stock and advance our knowledge of the interaction of materials and climate.

###"One Hundred and Eight"

Posted by @kamillacsegzi

Created by Nils Völker, One Hundred and Eight is an interactive wall-mounted Installation made out of ordinary garbage bags. Controlled by an Arduino and Processing, each of the bags is selectively inflated and deflated in turn by two cooling fans. The installation runs in either “patter mode” or reacting to people nearby.
The installation consists of 108 interconnected modules made from MDF. Each single one is equipped with a white, semi transparent plastic bag, two cooling fans and a relay that switches the electric current between the fans. One program is running on an Arduino mounted to the lower side taking control of a set of shift registers that trigger the relays individually. A camera is mounted to the ceiling above and connected to a computer on which a second program (Processing) is running. The program registers and tracks movement via the camera and sends the necessary information via a serial connection to the microcontroller.

###"Dune"

Posted by @kamillacsegzi

Designed by Studio Daan Roosegarden, it is a public interactive landscape that interacts with human behavior. This hybrid of nature and technology is composed of large amounts of fibers that brighten according to the sounds and motion of passing visitors. Evolving through several contexts DUNE 4.1 enhances social interactions in the public pedestrian Maastunnel, commissioned by the Rotterdam City of Architecture.

###"Playtime Interactive Dresses"

Posted by @kamillacsegzi

Designer Ying Gao is showing three series of "intelligent" garments which move and change in response to sound, motion or light in Quebec City this summer. Inspired by Jacques Tati's film Playtime (1967), the Playtime garment series illustrates the ability to metamorphose when one tries to take their picture. Playtime 1 reacts to a camera flash by contracting and becoming blurred as the fabric, activated by light-sensitive sensors, begins to undulate. For Ying gao, "this blurriness is a space of freedom which defies the supremacy of the image, that capital element of the fashion milieu."

###"Beast"

Posted by @kamillacsegzi

Beast is an organic-like entity created synthetically by the incorporation of physical parameters with digital form-generation protocols. A single continuous surface, acting both as structure and as skin, is locally modulated for both structural support and corporeal aid. Beast combines structural, environmental, and corporeal performance by adapting its thickness, pattern density, stiffness, flexibility, and translucency to load, curvature, and skin-pressured areas respectively.

###"WaterfallSwing"

Posted by @kamillacsegzi

The swing is a collaborative project between Mike O’Toole, Andrew Ratcliff, Ian Charnas and Andrew Witte.
Water recirculates through 273 independently controlled solenoid valves at the top of the structure to create a wall of water. This water starts from a collection pool on the ground and is pumped up to a large pipe that feeds the solenoids. Sensors mounted on the swingset gather information about the angle and speed of each swing. That information is sent to a computer that predicts the action of the rider. The computer then creates a hole in the wall of water, allowing the rider to swing through without getting wet.

###"Media Surfaces"

Posted by @warshawshaw

"Media Surfaces" is a pair of 'video sketches' by the design consultancy firm Berg London (the same guys who made the Little Printer) that don't put any impressive new technologies to work so much as they explore how the banal elements of consumer media in public spaces might be creatively appropriated. In "The Journey," for example, Berg imagines a train station that interacts with customers almost humanly: signs refer to each train by a name, the ticket kiosk displays a wait time, and arrival boards note which cars are most full. Capitalizing on the print elements of travel, the project includes personalized tickets that mention durations, weather, and points of interest for each journey.

###Void

Posted by @warshawshaw

In a similar vein to Jürg Lehni's work, Wit Pimkanchanapong's sculpture plots in space rather than on a 2D surface. A fly system anchored at eight points swings a weight with eight alternating light strips attached to it around the space of a vacant city lot. The effect in real time is of bright flashing lights that jump around the space, although long exposure photos capture the illuminated strips at individual light drawings.

### Mirror

Posted by @warshawshaw

"Mirror" is a permanent installation by Doug Aitken on the main facade of the Seattle Art Museum. Composed of two horizontal LED screen panels and multiple vertical LED strips, the piece culls snippets of video shot by the artist in and around Seattle and plays them in an always changing sequence. Sensors on the facade measure temperature and weather condition as well as traffic and pedestrian densities, rearranging the order of the montage in response.

###Illumiroom

Posted by @warshawshaw

Illumiroom is an augmented reality project by Microsoft Research that uses a projector and a Kinect for Windows camera to read the visuals of a videogame being played on a normal TV and extend its contents and motion out onto surrounding walls in order to fill in peripheral information. For example, if a user were playing a car racing game, it would unite the features of the room with those portrayed on-screen by overlaying the wider angle of a tight corner or a straightaway right over any furniture or adjacent surfaces. It can also make use of the room as a 3-D environment, making the motion of objects within the gameplay sensitive to the real-life environment once they pass from screen surface to room surface.

###Aireal

If Leap Motion and the Kinect allows users free gesture control for computers, games, robots, et cetera, the Aireal adds a layer of haptic feedback to their use. It works as if it were a webcam for tactile sensation. It is equipped with a camera that tracks a user's motion, and using a nozzle manipulated by a small motor, blasts targeted rings of air at the user's body to complement his or her simultaneous control of a visual display. If one is typing in midair using the Leap, for example, an Aireal positioned below the hands could simulate the tactile experience of hitting the keys by shooting bursts of air at each finger as it makes a keystroke. Depending on its position, it can also complement visuals that are projected onto the body, simulating, for example, the feeling of a bug crawling up an arm as a projected bug actually does so.

### Holistic Strata

Posted by @dinamahmoud

In addition to the characteristic elements of light and sound in his previous works, Hiroaki Umeda’s new piece Holistic Strata introduces a new system built around a key component of ‘physical data’ generated by the dancer’s body movements.

A further leap forward from Umeda’s tried and tested concept of treating light, sound and the human body as equivalent means of expression on stage, Holistic Strata revolves around the body as a complex cluster of information that configures actual spaces. Umeda’s body data (movements of muscles and locomotion coordinates) is manipulated with the help of sensing technology and results in the creation of a scenery that integrates dance, sound, and intensely blinking light. Based on this system of freely generated imagination, Holistic Strata proposes ‘dance’ as a spatial expression, while highlighting the criticality of our perception.

### Firewall

Posted by @dinamahmoud

An interactive media installation created in collaboration with Mike Allison. A stretched sheet of spandex acts as a membrane interface sensitive to depth that people can push into and create fire-like visuals and expressively play music.
Firewall was made using Processing, Max/MSP, Arduino and a Kinect. The Kinect measures the average depth of the spandex from the frame it's mounted on. If the material is not being pressed against, nothing happens. When someone presses into it the visuals react around where the person presses, and the music is triggered. An algorithm created with Max allows the music to speed up and slow down and get louder and softer, based on the depth. This provides a very expressive musical playing experience, even for people who have never played music before. A switch is built into the frame which toggles between two modes. The second mode is a little more aggressive than the first. [link](http://www.metalocus.es/content/en/blog/firewall-not-only-interactive-media-installation)

### Maison Hermes Window Display

Posted by @dinamahmoud

Based on a window display he first presented in 2004, the japanese designer tokujin yoshioka 
has now restructured it using a japanese actress currently being presented at Maison Hermès, 
japan. the installation will run from now until january 19th, 2010. 
'on designing a window-display of Maison Hermès, I intended to express people’s daily 'movements' 
with a suspicion of humor. there are moments when I perceive a hidden presence of a person in 
the movements born naturally in daily life. I created a design where one can perceive someone 
behind the scarves as if life were being breathed into them.
the window is designed with an image of woman projected on to a monitor. the scarf softly sways 
in the air in response to the woman’s blow. ' - TY [link](http://www.designboom.com/design/tokujin-yoshioka-maison-hermes-window-display/)

tokujin yoshioka's project 'snow' is a dynamic 15-meter-wide installation. 
it consists of a scene depicting hundreds of kilograms of light feathers blowing all over

### Filament Mind

Posted by @dinamahmoud

Filament Mind is a human information-driven installation designed to visualize the collective curiosities and questions of Teton County Library visitors through a dynamic and interactive spatial sculpture. 
Whenever any Wyoming public library visitor anywhere in the state performs a search of the library catalog from a computer, Filament Mind illuminates that search in a flash of color and light through glowing bundles of fiber optic cables. Each of the 1000 fiber optic cables hanging above (totaling over 5 miles of cable) corresponds to a call number in the Dewey Decimal System, which organizes the library’s collection into approximately 1000 categories of knowledge. These category titles are displayed in text on the lobby’s south and north walls at the termination points of the fiber optic cables.

### Hello Stranger

Posted by @yifeng

Hello Stranger was an interactive installation consisting of a field of 30 LED pillars arranged in a field and embedded in gravel. Each pillar is 3m tall and has 12 individually addressable RGB elements. Together they form a sparse 3D display which is immersive (you can walk through it), tangible (you can touch it) and real (as opposed to virtual). It was exhibited during the 2005 Science et Cite festival in Zurich. A non-interactive version was shown at the the 2006 Les yeux de la nuit exhibition in Geneva.

The interactions:
Heart - the beating red heart at the centre of the space speeds up as you approach it
Rain - it always rains red on you
Fire - release fireballs from the gravel as you walk
Cortex - simple 3D walk-through model of activation between and across layers of cortex
Flower - flowers open as you walk through the gravel
Tornado - swirling lights follow you around
Spectrum (not interactive) - possibly the world's biggest Hi-Fi spectrum analyser

### Communicative Display Skin for the Hunsthaus Graz

Posted by @yifeng

The idea of the media installation BIX arose out of considerations on how to equip the interior of the Kunsthaus in Graz with media (≥KMA). BIX was created as an additional feature at a time when overall planning of the Kunsthaus had already reached an advanced stage.Constructed from about 1,300 individually shaped, translucent Plexiglas panels covering the biomorphic building, the so-called skin was intended to feature different nuances of transparency, which would have created varying communicative relationships between interior and exterior.

### In Order to Control | Interactive Installation

by @yifeng

It’s one thing to stand in font of a projector to create shadow puppets, but it’s an entirely different experience to block a text-based floor projection and see your typographic silhouette on an adjacent wall. Istanbul-based multidisciplinary creative studio NOTA BENE Visual has designed a mind-boggling audiovisual installation using an intricately executed video-mapping technique that uses the latest technology to create an artistically intriguing environment for spectators to engage in.

### SFMOMA: LED Lights Transform into 3D Screen

Posted by @yifeng

Artist Jim Campbell just recently debuted "Exploded Views," a random cascade of flickering LED lights...or so you think. Make it up to the 2nd floor landing and watch the lights transform into a 3D screen where human figures magically come to life!
Part sculpture, part cinematic screen, the grid is composed of thousands of computer-controlled LED spheres that create the illusion of fleeting shadow-like figures.

### Lunar Trails

Posted by @jstoddart

_Lunar Trails_ was a project by artist, [Seb Lee-Delisle](http://seb.ly/), for the _GAME_ exhibition at the Dublin Science Gallery. The project used a vintage arcade game, Lunar Lander, and linked the player's actions on screen to a wall-drawing robot. The robot would inscribe each player's trajectory on the wall-mounted canvas, producing a layering of multiple attempt (and successes and failures) at landing their lunar lander.

### Blur: braincoats

Posted by @jstoddart

The _Braincoat_ was smart raincoat created for [Diller Scofidio's](http://dsrny.com/) Blur Building for the Swiss Expo in 2002, but was ultimately unrealized in the final project. With their sensory experience impaired by the pavilion's fog generators, the _braincoat _acted as a proximity-based social surrogate, using sensors and logic to instigate interaction. Prior to entering the pavilion, users were asked to fill out a questionnaire. Once inside the pavilion, the coats would illuminate and vibrate to identify levels of compatibility with other nearby visitors, with "emotional responses" ranging from affinity to antipathy.

### Hektor

Posted by @jstoddart

[Hektor](http://hektor.ch/) is "a portable Spray-paint Output Device for laptop computers" created by Jürg Lehni in 2002. The system runs on a custom-build signal processor to interpret and translate vector drawings (via Adobe Illustrator scripting) into the physical realm. Hektor is at it's core a vertical CNC drawing machine using a custom-built platorm to hold and operate the spray can and suspended from two stepper motors via a cables. It uses the messiness of the medium (spray paint) to generate work that eschews the precision typically produced through the CNC process. The platform was designed to be mobile, and has been exhibited in multiple settings include museum shows where it produces work in collaboration created by a guest artist.

###Rain Room

Posted by @jstoddart

The Rain Room is an installation piece by the artist collective [rAndom International](http://random-international.com/) originally displayed in 2012 in London, and most recently shown in 2013 at [MOMA](http://www.momaps1.org/expo1/module/rainroom/). The installation employed a sprinkler system connected to a sensor array via solenoid valves. The sensors would detect motion and proximity of viewers and shut off the water supply above their location, allowing them to pass through the rain without getting wet.

### Daniel Rozin - Mechanical Mirror series

Posted by @jstoddart

Artist [Daniel Rozin](http://www.smoothware.com/danny) has created a series of analog mirror projects that translate an image of the viewer, to a representation via mechanical movement of physical "pixels". The input camera is either located within or near the piece, and a computer processes the image to translate values of light & dark. An array of servos then translate this brightness value to physical movement, reorienting the pixels. The material for the pixels changes from project to project along with the mechanism for reflecting the brightness values. In some works, the pixels have material orientations (via tilting in the [Trash Mirror](http://www.smoothware.com/danny/newtrashmirror.html) or surface texture in the [Brushed Metal Mirror](http://www.smoothware.com/danny/brushedmetalmirror.html)), so rotations change the quality of the reflected light. In others (such as the [Circles Mirror](http://www.smoothware.com/danny/circlesmirror.html) and the [Weave Mirror](http://www.smoothware.com/danny/weavemirror.html)), the pixels have a gradient value and rotation reveals a lighter or darker value.

### Street Bump

Posted by @jnquick

A project of Boston's Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics, Street Bump helps residents improve their neighborhood streets. Volunteers use the Street Bump mobile app to collect road condition data while they drive. Boston aggregates the data across users to provide the city with real-time information to fix short-term problems and plan long-term investments.

In partnership with New Urban Mechanics, Connected Bits designed and developed the app, collaborating with IDEO and building upon research by Professor Fabio Carrera. The City of Boston will make the app freely available so others can use and build on the project's efforts.

The app uses the accelerometer and GPS data built into app users' smartphones. See more on [Street Bump](http://www.streetbump.org/about), [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/38233136), Follow Street Bump on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/streetbump), or download it on the [App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/street-bump/id528964742?mt=8).

### Haze

Posted by @jnquick

Designed by Salon Architects for the 2013 Young Architects Program at Istanbul Modern, Haze is a pavilion that shifts the perception of a specific shore condition of the Tophane Pier with an experiential design. As the installation transforms Istanbul Modern into a garden of stages it also prepares an unexpected architectural condition for the distant relationship of İstanbul and the sea. The space brings water and people together in a unique way in the middle of a 1.5 km customs border wall, which is located in the city center.

Haze creates its own cool microclimate in the warmest days of the year it also accommodates various interesting events. The pavillion offers self-organizing events for public to allow the diffusion of social clusters and to create the mutual understandings between them. It has 3 different stages that are surrounded with various seating platforms as well as shaded lodges.

The mystery of this hazy space that resembles like floating platforms in the water is the cool air that consists of micro water particles which has been sprayed from about 200 nozzles. As the day gets darker, the space turns into a virtual installation that is fusing the digital and physical almost like it merges the sea and the land. Platforms, lodges and seating elements are made out of Ferro-concrete lightweight modules, which is different than the common use of concrete in Istanbul. After summer these modules are going to be re-used in different shores with different functions to activate these selected areas.

### Vertwalker

Posted by @jnquick

The Vertwalker is a machine that can move on vertical surfaces. It can crawl on interior walls, take a walk on buildings and explore the city in a way humans can’t.  Our “up” is its “forward”.

Carrying a marker, the Vertwalker becomes a painter. Exploring new territories in the vertical.
 
There have been two Vertwalker prototypes we used for the installation “Trial Record” at the Blooom Art Show in Cologne and at Musrara Mix Festival in Jerusalem. With all we learned from those experiences we put into the redesign of this new Vertwalker.

Materials: PA casing, foam boards, motors, sensors, custom electronics, custom software
Idea and initial design: Achim Meyer

###Trinity

posted by @jnquick

Trinity is a dance performance with high levels of real time interaction and close relationship between: dance, sound and visuals.

The interactive link is done through a videocamera installed above the stage and under infrared lighting. Besides positional tracking the project is focus in measuring movement qualities as: forces and directions, accelerations, stage position, velocity and body area.

The performance has been created and executed in live using the environment MAX/MSP/JITTER by Cycling74 and the computer vision library CV.JIT by Jean-Marc Pelletier.

###User 632

posted by @jnquick

User 632 is an installation by Undef that stores the behaviour of the people who look at it by monitoring them in return. It wants to know when and how a person passes by or if they stop on the way. 

All data is being tracked and displayed publicly. Passersby are stored as an annonymous number without any hints to their identities. Whoever comes to close to the camera though will be stored with a photograph next to their id.

The installation is made up of three Kinect depth cameras that constantly look for movements which are then reduced to a simple directional line in space. When a visitor enteres a specific area, the algorithm is looking for a face. As soon as one is found a countdown appears that shows the time until a photo is taken automatically. At the same time the time a user is in the visible area is stored.
This data (time, path and eventually image) are stored in a database, interpreted and displayed as realtime statistics. Installed February 23rd -  May 16th 2013 at howald fosco, St. Johanns-Vorstadt 46, Basel using
C++, OpenFrameworks, OpenNI, mysql, php, javascript, and Kinect.
