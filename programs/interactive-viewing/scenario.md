##	Interactive Viewing

The interaction between physical and digital world is usually achieved through movement of people. If the sync of the movement and what we see in real world can be transferred into the digital screen, it can somewhat create the feeling of being in that reality. Like the 360 camera that allows you to look you 360’ photo exactly the way you take it. This interaction brings the sense of reality. 
The interactive platform can be a stable screen (work with a projector), and also can be the screen of an ipad / iphone. Working with a sensor measures the distance, probably also the direction, the digital world in the screen can change according to people’s movement.
