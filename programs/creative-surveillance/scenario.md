##	Creative Surveillance

Creative Surveillance will detect activity in any Studio-X location around the world using a motion sensor and simultaneously project a video feed of activity there onto a wall in the other Studio-X locations.


## Scenario

When a Studio-X space is occupied during a lecture, workshop, or other event, the arduino will receive informatino from one or more motion sensors in the location and prompt a video camera to start recording the room. A Raspberry Pi computer connected to the internet will relay the feed in real time to other Studio-X spaces around the globe, where a counterpart setup will play the video live on a wall by controlling a ceiling- or wall-mounted projector.

Depending on the camera, occupants of one space could [zoom, focus, and record](http://controlyourcamera.blogspot.com/2011/02/arduino-powered-lanc-remote.html) remotely for playback later. It would also be possible to connect the arduino to use a [video experimenter shield](http://nootropicdesign.com/ve/index.html) connecter to a joystick/controller to overlay graphics onto the video feed.

A classmate or instructor will add their notes here. For example:

Lorem ipsum you should check out [Raphael Lozano-Hemmer's](http://www.lozano-hemmer.com/) work, it's all about orchestration and shared experiences. Lorem ipsum, ipsum lorem.
