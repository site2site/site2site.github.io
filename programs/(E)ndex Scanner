Scenario

The idea is to rethink the architectural models and the the way that we store the information. The model will act as archive
of informations collected by the studios. The user can choose an area, scan it and view the information collected for this site.
Additionally he can choose to visualize certain design proposals which can be projected on the model.

A classmate or instructor will add their notes here. For example:
