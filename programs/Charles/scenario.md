##Musical Stairs

###Description

Musical Stairs will play different sounds as you walk up and down stairs, in hopes of promoting exercise by encouraging people to use stairs more frequently. 

###Scenario

When someone ascends or descends the staircase, music will play. How fast someone walks and the intensity of the impact of the step will affect how fast and how loud the music plays, respectively. 

The setup requires placing pressure and acceleration-sensing piezoelectric sensors on each step of the staircase which will collect signals. The sensors will likely need to be embbeded beneath an ornamental element, such as a strip of tape or rug in order to function well. The sensors will detect the speed and force of the steps and send them as signals to an Arduino unit, which would route the electronic signals to the computer. A computer program - yet to be determined at this point - will translate the input signals from the sensor, which measured the force and impact of the individual steps, and output the melody through two stereo speakers at a speed and loudness level corresponding to the speed and pressure of the footsteps.


Music stairs will offer the individual elements of control, participation and, hopefully, immense entertainment value that the he will choose to use the stairs over the elevator more often.

Attached is the illustrated scenario.

###Critique

A classmate or instructor will add their notes here. For example:

Lorem ipsum you should check out Raphael Lozano-Hemmer's work, it's all about orchestration and shared experiences. Lorem ipsum, ipsum lorem.
