##	Program/J.O.E

[Joint. Office. Energy.] A cup of coffee fueled by office #votership. 

## Scenario

An office seeks to achieve efficiency of workflow and production, why shouldn't its appliances do the same? J.O.E. creates a need-based coffee machine to provide workers with coffee when they need it, while insuring that they receive just as much as they order. This method attempts to address (and reduce) excess coffee production, only 'running' once the machine has received a threshold of #votes.

A hashtag function would allow the coffee machine to process a certain number of votes (say 8 votes = 8 cups of coffee.) While this process is at first more interactive locally, there is potential for this to become a globalized interaction. Where a client abroad could 'pay' for or 'support' coffee / tea use during a deadline. This could become an opportunity for sponsorhip, where you could offer a cup of coffee to start-up offices that might not be otherwise able to afford one.  

## Critique

A classmate or instructor will add their notes here. For example:

Lorem ipsum you should check out [Raphael Lozano-Hemmer's](http://www.lozano-hemmer.com/) work, it's all about orchestration and shared experiences. Lorem ipsum, ipsum lorem.
