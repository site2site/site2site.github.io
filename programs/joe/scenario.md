##	Program/joe

[joint. office. energy.] A cup of coffee fueled by office #votership. 

## Scenario

j.o.e. creates a need-based coffee machine. Providing workers with coffee while insuring that they receive just as much as is ordered. This method attempts to address (and reduce) excess coffee production, only running once the machine has received a threshold of #votes.

A hashtag function delivered through Twitter or Facebook would allow the coffee machine to process a certain number of votes (say 8 votes = 8 cups of coffee.) While this process is at first interactive locally, there is potential for this framework to become a globalized interaction. A client abroad could 'support' coffee or tea use during an impending deadline. This relationship might become an opportunity for sponsorship or certain incentives, where one might act as a sponsor, offering cups of coffee to start-up offices that might not be otherwise able to afford one.  

## Critique

I like the idea of this program and that it can be local as well as global. I do like your first idea that it could also be tied to body language/position although it would be harder to gauge personal habits vs. tiredness. You might want to look at making this a french press if you want more of a challenge.
