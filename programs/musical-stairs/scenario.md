##Musical Stairs

###Description

Musical Stairs will play different sounds as you walk up and down stairs, in hopes of promoting exercise by encouraging people to use stairs more frequently. 

###Scenario

When someone ascends or descends the staircase, music will play. How fast someone walks and the intensity of the impact of the step will affect how fast and how loud the music plays, respectively. 

The setup requires placing pressure and acceleration-sensing piezoelectric sensors on each step of the staircase which will collect signals. The sensors will likely need to be embbeded beneath an ornamental element, such as a strip of tape or rug in order to function well. The sensors will detect the speed and force of the steps and send them as signals to an Arduino unit, which would route the electronic signals to the computer. A computer program - yet to be determined at this point - will translate the input signals from the sensor, which measured the force and impact of the individual steps, and output the melody through two stereo speakers at a speed and loudness level corresponding to the speed and pressure of the footsteps.


Music stairs will offer the individual elements of control, participation and, hopefully, immense entertainment value that the he will choose to use the stairs over the elevator more often.

Attached is the illustrated scenario.

###Critique

I like the simplicity of the program, where a non-calculated action (taking a step) produces a sensory response. I think the simplicity is a critical building point because it has room to be expanded/reworked/subverted as the research/experimentation continues. Some things to consider here:
*	I'm not sure if there are steps within the Studio X NYC space (embarassingly, I've never been), so are there alternative places to integrate this experience?
*	I think you could dive a little bit deeper into the program/app's effect on how people use the space. You touch on this with the hope that it leads to a preference of stairs over elevator, but I think the response to the sound will change over time as the novelty wears off. Will the musical steps be a sonic shaming if someone arrives late to lecture/symposium/workshop?
*	Will the effect always maintain anonymity? Is it possible to have the sonic response essentially become a signature of an individual (where you can know who just walked in before you even see them)? Can the users personalize the sounds that accompany their footsteps?
*	Is the response always immediate? Would it be possible to log the sensor's readings as a form of documenting an event? What could the value of that documentation be in an archival sense (if any)?
