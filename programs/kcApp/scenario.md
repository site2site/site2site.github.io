##	24H - Insomnia

'The basic concept is extremely simple: an open space of collaborative work and exchange of ideas.' Mark Wigley


## Scenario
The system embraces the core idea behind the Studio X Golbal - open platforms for creativity and communication interconected between each other.
'Not a school, think-tank, gallery, performance space, communication center, or officeâ€“but elements of all.
Studio-X is an open flexible work area with exhibition space, book gallery, lecture space, meeting space, some offices and a serious espresso machine...'
The space is a system of modules (furniture, panles, canvas etc.) that can move along predifined axes according to the different functions.
It is controled locally and globally through an App. 

Example scenario: - 08:00PM - Beijing - Lecture - panels (furniture) arranged accordinlgy: open space, projection
                  - 08:00AM - NYC - office - decides to join the lecture - by selecting the 'Join' option, the space rearranges
                  
Studio X becomes a space of overlapping events.

## Critique

I think your concept is quite successful in its clarity and power for expansion and new potentialities. It taps into the 
core opporunity that sensor technology provides, which is to react instantly to new conditions and re-connect the 
non-physical, digital world with our sensual, spatial reality. The next step would be to really flesh out and refine 
what 'furniture' is being actuated (moving a couch is a very different proposition than sliding curtains on a rail) and 
how (are paths pre-defined or free; to what degree are they being directly controlled by users--say, a remote-controlled 
office chair--versus automatically reacting to conditions like light, foot traffic, or event type?). Given that we are 
working with open source hardware, it might be interesting to think about how your program might be 'hacked' by Studio-X 
users. How you approach these questions radically affect the ultimate meaning of your project, so definitely think about 
the possibilities and implications of each of your choices. Anyways, I hope my input was productive, and I'm looking 
forward to seeing how this program evolves!
