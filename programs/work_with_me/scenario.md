##	Work With Me

W.W.M (Work With Me) is a webased platform that connects essential furnitures and office spaces to a network while tracking their uses along with individual employee whereabouts, emotions, and current preoccupation. The aim of this platform is to  create a virtual office enviornment embedded with information you would witness in a physical office space. 


## Scenario

Every member of the office is connected via phone app into the space. Each work furniture has a sensor and an ID correlating to the individual who uses it. Data is organized on the website and displayed in an interface that allows members from other offices visualize the environment. Members are pinged to update their status/message to broadcasted globally.
