##	Global X

I propose a device that would start out in one location and can later be implemented in other. At that point the locations will become interactive and integrated.


## Scenario

When the first person enters a room, the coffee machine starts.

## Narrative

The door will have a motion sensor that will be able to tell if someone enters the room. If there is no one in the room the sensor will send a signal to the coffee machine and the coffee will start. Entering a room is an important part of experienceing an architectural space. Coffee in a studio X location is the fuel that runds the creative group.

## Objects

The scenario needs a person, a door, a motion sensor and a coffee machine.

## Critique

Great idea, I would just add some more conditions which define in which circumstances exactly the machine will start. Does it only start when the first person of the day enters (if the room is previously empty) or is there a way to start it as each separate person enters the room for that day.
