##	Flex Sensor

![Flex Sensor](https://dlnmh9ip6v2uc.cloudfront.net//images/products/1/0/2/6/4/10264-01.jpg)

A simple flex sensor. As the sensor is flexed, the resistance across the sensor increases.  

The resistance of the flex sensor changes when the metal pads are on the outside of the bend (text on inside of bend).
