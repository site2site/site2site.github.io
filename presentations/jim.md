### (1) Architecture = Definition of Space
### (2) API = Platform for Communication
### &there4; Architectural API = Platform for Communicating Between Spaces

***

#### Historically, architecture has defined the notion of place — fixing culture, people, and history to discrete locations on the planet. However, we are in transition, exchanging the stability and clarity of boundaries for an increase in connectivity. 

#### The Architectural API facilitates this exchange, a common language for augmenting the physical objects that already populate our environments to both collect and recieve data and to serve as conduits between physically separated spaces.


## On our way to here...

####  Parthenon: Architecture communicating a place and a past

#### US Capitol: Architecture communicating a place, an idea, and an identity

#### Studio-X: Architecture communicating what? Perhaps, Architecture for communicating.

## Architectural Communication Technology
![Window and Door](https://raw.github.com/site2site/Studio-Xoup/master/presentations/stoddart_images/studioX-windowdoor%20copy.png)

The major advances in communicative architectural devices - the door, the window, and the sign.

This is still the reality of how our spaces allow us to communicate with each other.

##Non-Architectural Communication Technology
![Communication Technology](https://raw.github.com/site2site/Studio-Xoup/master/presentations/stoddart_images/studioX_commTech.png)

Telephone (sound) --> Television (image) --> Internet (information)

![Mobile Hub](http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Apple-advert-FaceTime-Meet-Her.png)

All communication technologies collapsed into portable mobile hubs.

### Transmitted communication is always limited to a terminal

### Role of API is to standardize the message transmission so that any object can become a terminal

#### This works with existing objects...
![Everyday Objects](https://raw.github.com/site2site/Studio-Xoup/master/presentations/stoddart_images/studioX_objects.png)

#### ...or new connected (proprietary) products...

#### ...or with custom objects built from inexpensive components...

##Back to Studio-X...


#### This is the diagram for Studio-X, a series of nodes linked together...

#### ...but what are those links? Do they even exist?

### What is Studio-Xoup?

#### Xoup is a common platform for curating, publishing and sharing content. Studio-X produces content, but lacks a coherent medium for exchanging ideas both internally and externally.

#### Xoup builds off available, inexpensive technology stacks—a combination of low-cost micro-computers, micro-controllers, and a customizable array of sensors—capable of collecting and processing information from the Studio-X spaces. This technology stack is packed into a custom product, deployable to any number of spaces seeking to be connected.
![Xoup Object](https://raw.github.com/site2site/Studio-Xoup/master/images/Device/S2S_device_Elevation.png)

#### Using a simple method of applying physical tags, Xoup collects, crops, tags, and processes the content for sharing. Different tags produce different results, from sharing publicly, to sharing amongst all Studio-X locations, to semi-private messaging between two Studio-X locations.

#### Xoup also encourages external participation and documentation of the people who populate Studio-X, while automatically processing images to maintain the Studio-X brand.

#### Xoup collects this content and publishes it in three key forms:

####(1)
#### A new API, providing access to the data streams of Studio-X to internal and external development, allowing for the creation of new uses and platforms for data distribution.

#### (2)
####A stream of data, rendered physical, in each Studio-X locations allows all members to be aware of happenings at other locations. Ideas can be borrowed, exchanged, critiqued and members can decide to contribute to another's line of inquiry.
![Ticker Tape](https://raw.github.com/site2site/Studio-Xoup/master/presentations/stoddart_images/studioX_tickerTape.png)

####(3)
####Xoup shares this content online, using existing social media platforms, compiling the production, the happenings, and the people of all Studio-X into one accessible location.

![Xoup Tumblr](https://raw.github.com/site2site/Studio-Xoup/master/tumblr_theme/screenshots/xoup_01.png)

Content is shared chronologically, and tagged with information regarding the location, event, and ephemeral data.

![Xoup Tumblr Sort](https://raw.github.com/site2site/Studio-Xoup/master/tumblr_theme/screenshots/xoup_02.png)

Content can be filtered and sorted by this tagged information, to focus the stream to one location's output.

### Why Xoup?

#### (1) Studio-X is imbalanced. Xoup provides a platform of parity.
Studio-X NYC is the chief agent of the network, producing the majority of the content due to proximity to the source (GSAPP + Funding). Studio-X NYC's current outlets are suited to the local scene, but don't scale to the extents of the Studio-X network. Xoup provides an equal platform for all locations to contribute to the dialogue - creating the potential for a content production network that produces across all timezones.

#### (2) Studio-X has an image problem.
The current main outputs of Studio-X (C-LAB and Volume) fit within the existing pedagogy of architectural publication, but they aren't guaged at reaching a larger audience. By freeing itself from the rigid framework of Avery, Studio-X has the opportunity to expose contemporary architectural practice, theory, and activisim to a larger audience. This is seen as a complement to the existing outlets, a way of reaching out to both old and new audiences.

#### (3) Studio-X is a protypical model for a distributed architectural space.
Studio-X's global footprint allows it to stay at the forefront of relevancy, and not get trapped behind any one culture. This also posed a problem of how to unite spaces that are physically and culturally seperated. By tapping into the commonality of architecture shared between them, we can create a new type of architectural space—linked by functionality and information flows—while still retaining the individual character of each node.
