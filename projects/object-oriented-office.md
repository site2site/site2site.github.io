## Object-Oriented Office (OOO)

## Unoccupied Opportunities

###A dashboard display highlighting chair occupancies, directions, and interactions.

### The chair is the common platform of the office, a fairly pedestrian object designed for ergonomics, but an untapped resource.

### Sensors translate position into program.

### Scales of Influence

1.	Local / Person to Person
2.	Global / Person to Cloud
3.	Local-Global / Person to Cloud to Person

### Strategies for Success

1.	A slipcover design containing all sensors 
2. 	limit use to three chairs in Studio-X New York
3.	Quanitify actions with respect to time and ergonomics retrieved from sensor outputs 
4.  Display Analytics on a web based dashboard
5.  Connect Dashboard to other global offices

## Component Workflow

### Sensor inputs from chair are processed by the Arduino.

### Inputs are translated and parsed by the RaspberryPI and the cloud into local and global responses.
